- Ruby version: `3.2.1`

Hello, for my Command Line Interface (CLI) project,

I made a simple rock-paper-scissors game.

How the Program works:
  1) the program greets the user and asks the player what he/she would like to play (rock, paper, or scissors)
  2) After that, the computer (CPU) plays its move (rock, paper, or scissors)
  3) Depending on the moves made, either the Player or the CPU win (or there is a tie)!
  4) After that, the user is given the option to play another round.

Note:
  - After each game, the program also shows the number of game played, the number of times player won, and the number of times the CPU won!
  - The player can also 'help' to get instructions on how to play rock paper scissors and use this interface.

How to play or open this game:
  1) Go to the command line
  2) In the terminal, go to the same directory that main.rb is in
  3) Type "Ruby main.rb" in the command line to run the game!

Thanks for reading this, and enjoy!
